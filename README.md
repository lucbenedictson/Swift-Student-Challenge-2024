# Swift-Student-Challenge-2024
This was my submission to the 2024 Swift Student Challenge. 
This was my first app that I built and I did it in just a few days over my reading week. 

The app is a To Do List. Its features include adding, removing, and editing taskings as well as clearing all tasks. 
On top of this, the list will persist between lauches.
